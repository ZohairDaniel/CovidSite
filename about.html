    <h1>About COVID-19</h1>
    
        <p>COVID-19 is an illness caused by a coronavirus. Human  coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses,  similar to the common cold.</p>
    <p> Symptoms of human coronaviruses may be very mild or more serious,  such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Cough</li>
      <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the  virus.</p>
    <p> Coronaviruses are most  commonly spread from an infected person through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>respiratory droplets  when you cough or sneeze</li>
      <li>close personal  contact, such as touching or shaking hands</li>
      <li>touching  something with the virus on it, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before  washing your hands</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These viruses are not known to spread through ventilation systems  or through water.</p>
    <p> The best way to prevent the spread of infections is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>wash your hands often with soap and water for at       least 20 seconds;</li>
      <li>avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially       with unwashed hands;</li>
      <li>avoid close contact with people who are sick;</li>
      <li>cough and sneeze into your sleeve and not your       hands; </li>
      <li>practice physical       distancing at all times;</li>
      <li>stay home if you are sick to avoid spreading illness       to others; and</li>
      <li>wear a non-medical       mask or face covering (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the       head by ties or ear loops) to protect the people and surfaces around you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>The Government of Canada has  implemented an Emergency Order under the&nbsp;<em>Quarantine Act.</em>&nbsp;This order means that  everyone who is entering Canada by air, sea or land has to stay home for 14  days in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. The 14-day period begins on the  day you enter Canada.</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>If       you have travelled and have no symptoms, you must&nbsp;quarantine&nbsp;(self-isolate).</li>
      <li>If       you have travelled and have symptoms, you must&nbsp;isolate.</li>
